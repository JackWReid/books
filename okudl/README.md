# Oku Download (okudl)

A very basic script that downloads the data from my Oku reading lists and converts them into JSON to be used on my personal website.

Written in Go, so you'll need to run `go build` to create the binary, which you can copy into your $PATH somewhere. All it *should* need from that point is an internet connection to download the RSS files from Oku.
