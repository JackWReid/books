- **Identify refactoring opportunities** in existing code during development
- **Offer to implement refactoring** when it improves code quality or maintainability
- **Focus on the main task first** - refactoring should not block primary feature development
- **Document refactoring decisions** in the appropriate documentation files
- **Follow the API client patterns** established in the internal/api directory
- **Handle errors gracefully** with meaningful error messages
- **Implement rate limiting** and timeout handling for external APIs
