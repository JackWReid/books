# Personal Book Management

This repo is a collection of various tools and applications I've built
to keep track of my book collection, wish list, and currently reading
status.

- *book-collection* - An outdated JSON file of the books I owned
- *book-collection-viewer* - An outdated React app to view owned books
- *node-book-api* - API that connected to a VPS-hosted postgres db
- *go-books-api* - Same as above but in Golang
- *graphql-api* - Serves book info from defunct DB in with Graphql
- *books-api-lamda* - Same as above but for opinioned Zeit lamda

At the time of writing, I'm moving much of this stuff to just use
Goodreads.
