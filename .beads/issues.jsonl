{"id":"cover-lne","title":"Support cover list for non-status lists","description":"Allow cover list to fetch lists like \"Owned\" or \"Bad Smart People\" that are not status-based.","notes":"Status: in_progress.\n\nContext: cover list currently resolves status names (reading/toread/read) in cmd/list.go: displaySpecificList -\u003e getStatusID(listName), else scans user lists (GetUserLists) and fetches list by ID (GetListBooks). This already supports custom list names, but may not support non-status lists like Owned/Bad Smart People due to API differences (these appear as special lists, possibly not returned by me{lists} or list_books).\n\nFiles reviewed:\n- cmd/list.go (displaySpecificList, displayAllLists)\n- internal/api/hardcover.go (GetUserLists, GetListBooks, GetUserBooks)\n- cmd/list_test.go (custom list test uses lists + lists_by_pk mocks)\n- docs/hardcover-api/GraphQL/Schemas/Lists.mdx (list schema + queries)\n- docs/hardcover-api/GraphQL/Schemas/Books.mdx (list_books query for user collection)\n- docs/hardcover-api/GraphQL/Schemas/Activities.mdx (List Activity example shows Owned list path @user/lists/owned)\n- fixtures/schema (lists fields include url, object_type, ranked, featured, privacy_setting_id, etc)\n\nOpen questions / likely fix:\n- Owned list may not be a user-created list; might be a special list or list_books derived from user_books owned flag or tags. In schema, user_books has \"owned\" field (bool) but no tags relation. lists type supports url/path/featured/etc. Might need separate query for special lists or use list_books with filters.\n- Determine GraphQL query to fetch non-status list by name/path/slug. Possibly query lists(where: {name: {_ilike: ...}, user_id: {_eq: me.id}}) instead of me{lists}? Note: users.lists has no args in schema, so me{lists} may return only custom lists?\n\nNext steps:\n1) Identify GraphQL query that returns Owned/Bad Smart People from docs or schema. Maybe query lists(where: {name: {_ilike: ...}, user_id: {_eq: me.id}}) instead of me{lists}.\n2) If non-status list is derived (Owned), consider query list_books with filters: user_books.owned == true (from schema: user_books has owned). Need to check if list_books exposes user_books relationship to filter.\n3) Update GetUserLists/GetListBooks or add new client method for special lists.\n4) Add tests in cmd/list_test.go for a non-status list name (\"Owned\"/\"Bad Smart People\") once API query known.\n\nNote: python3 is available; python not found. bd commands run with warning about daemon slow start.\n","status":"in_progress","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","owner":"jack.r@miro.com","created_at":"2026-01-15T23:46:16.960851+01:00","created_by":"Jack Reid","updated_at":"2026-01-16T00:03:51.046555+01:00"}
